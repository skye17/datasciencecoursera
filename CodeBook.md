###Data processing
####Collection of the raw data
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and 
then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth 
low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only 
low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 
###Creating the tidy data file
#####Guide to create a tidy data file
1. Download the raw data
2. Merge train and test sets
3. Extract mean and standard deviation characteristics of each measurement
4. Group merged set by subject who performed the activity and the activity
5. Summarise mean value of each characteristic in merged set to new data set.
